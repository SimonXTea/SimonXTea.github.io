# I want to start making Youtube tutorials.

Making a channel for Youtube tutorials sounds like a good idea. I think there are tutorials lacking in some areas. My plan is to make a website and a youtube channel where I can teach people how to do tech related things, the videos would be short and simple and the priority with each video is

**Perfection**

Don't get me wrong. I don't obssess over being a perfectionist. I will obssess with this channel though. People are very prone to make mistakes when they make tutorials, I am prone to mistakes as well, I have to do a lot of retakes to get a tutorial right. I don't think most channels are aiming for perfectionism. I think that my idea of perfectionism and my artistic vision, will make me stand out. Not only that, but it's also going to be a challenge, a very difficult challenge that may be overwhelming (planning will be the most overwhelming part). I would do a lot of retakes

I would also make a lot of *very* short videos. 10-60 seconds long. For basic things. Sometimes you don't need a full tutorial on how to configure a router, instead you just want to know how to delete something.

I even have my avatar planned out! my character, I just need to set it up. I also had planned out the music I am going to use for this channel, please listen to it here: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZx7QBDDxDPLsUSfaHP4-5oSWXtXFuQeP](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZx7QBDDxDPLsUSfaHP4-5oSWXtXFuQeP)

Another idea I have is to make speedrun tutorials, rushed tutorials. That may not be a good idea though. I might not make them, but if I do, they are going to be rare and mainly for entertainment purposes.

I'll update with an image of my avatar once I make it.
