A lot of people have an online username or nickname they go by, it can be useful in many ways. It's unique, and it makes you look better in some websites.

I have an online username (as everyone does), it's Syax. I don't try to hide it because that makes things complicated

Sy is a reference to the common mispronounciation of my name, it's okay to pronounce it that way. X is a reference to my middle name. A is just there because I didn't want my name to be 6, so instead I added a vowel and a is the one that sounds better compared to the other vowels.

How do you pronounce it? However you want
