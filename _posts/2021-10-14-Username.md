A lot of people have an online username or nickname they go by, it can be useful in many ways. It's unique, memorable, short, and it makes you look better in some places.

I have an online username (as everyone does). I don't want to make it obvious that it's me though, I am pretty sure people can figure it out on their own if they look hard enough. I don't mind if you find out, some people already had.
