A lot of people have an online username or nickname they go by, it can be useful in many ways. It's unique, and it makes you look better in some websites.

I have an online username (as everyone does). I don't want to make it obvious that it's me though, I am pretty sure people can figure it out on their own if they look hard enough. I don't mind if you find out, some people already had.

What about my face? That's the only thing I try to hide. People can post pictures about me, and even say that's me in the picture, but I don't want to post those pictures myself, and I am never using my face as a profile picture. I also don't the service to know that one in the picture is me (I know some won't understand this). The reason for this is because I am not comfortable with how some websites can use a real picture once they know they can attach a real identity to it, it feels invasive, careless, and non-consensual.

I still won't post it here, I mean it's odd given the context that this is the site that I show employers, why do you want to look at my face? An employer could treat me unfairly based on my looks, or the color of my skin, it could be good or bad. I don't want this.

Of course, my face can be on my id, or my profile on the organization. That's safe, and very different.
