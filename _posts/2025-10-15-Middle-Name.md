# About My Middle Name

Fun fact about my middle name, "X".

I always include the initials of my middle name everywhere. This is odd for some people. I don't do this for any cultural reasons, you see, me and my father share the same first and last name. This is not a strange practice but many people seem to be unfamiliar to it. It often leads to a lot problems with communication and legal documents, which takes valuable time. Adding my middle name initials solves this issue. This is a weird problem as well, because people had at times mistaken me for my father, and let me make decisions on his behalf when they weren't supposed to.
Also, whenever I am credited, I want the credits of my work to go to me, not my father.

I always include the initials of my middle name to avoid these problems. I don't usually include the full middle name because that can also lead to confusion, regarding which one is my last name and such.

**In short words: I always include my middle name initial because it makes life easier for everybody. It distinguishes me from my father.**

I don't have plans to change my name, I don't want to. It was suggested that I call myself "Simon jr" or "Simon The 2nd", and I don't like that. Sometimes to avoid the issues mentioned above, I instead name myself something on the spot, this is more common on phone calls (never legal documents). Denis Tea is a common nickname, as well as Ben Cave.

Should I give my full name on this website? Could that have negative repercussions in the future? Maybe, I am not sure. All you are going to get is Simon X Camilo, if you want the full name you can ask through a private medium, such as instant messaging or email.
