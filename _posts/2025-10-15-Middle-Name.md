# About My Middle Name

Fun fact about my middle name, "X".

I always include the initials of my middle name everywhere. Some people find this odd. I don't do this for any cultural reasons, I do this because I share the same first and last name as my father. This is very common in many countries including the US, regardless a lot of people are unfamiliar and very puzzled at this. This often leads to a lot problems with communication and legal documents, which takes valuable time from both parties. Adding my middle name initials solves this issue most of the time.
I also want to be credited for my work properly, I don't want people to think my father made it.

I don't include the full middle name because that can also lead to confusion, regarding which one is my last name and such.

**In short words: I always include my middle name initial because it makes life easier for everybody. It distinguishes me from my father.**

I don't have plans to change my name, I don't want to. It was suggested that I call myself "Simon jr" or "Simon The 2nd", and I don't like that. Sometimes to avoid the issues mentioned above, I instead name myself something else on the spot, this is more common on phone calls (never legal documents). I often go by either Denis Tea is or Ben Cave.

My full name is Simon X **Camilo Baez**. Camilo Baez are my last names. The image below is a hint as to what my full middle name is.
