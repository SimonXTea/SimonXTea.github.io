# Pygame

I had a simple college assignment to make a modified version of PyGame. Click here to try it (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hajZ6teNrvmH8zLRa5pVsMZlpsI6B0hz?usp=sharing)

A preview can be seen below.

List of modifications
- A scoring system
- Full screen
- Redesign, night mode friendly
- More rows and columns, more difficult
- Background music
- Mute music (Press M)
- Ability to change the volume
- Sound effects when moving tiles
- An easter egg / secret (Press w 10 times). This won’t affect your score. You can’t disable the secret once unlocked
