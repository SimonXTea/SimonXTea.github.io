# Analyzing and Comparing data with Juniper Notebook

I was taught to use Juniper Notebook in order to compare data and suggest what application should a company develop, in order to get the most benefit. 
There are three sets of instructions on how to do the assignment. The summarized version is heavily edited by me. The chippy version has some edits. The normal version is the original one given by my professor

There's not a lot of text here because this was done long ago
