# More info?

I don't know, I don't want to fill the homepage with information about me. This is the last post I'll make talking about me. I'll make a list of fun facts.

- A lot of people think that I speak english natively, and think I come from an english speaking country. My first language is spanish, and it will be difficult for most to guess what country I am from.
- It's very easy for me to learn things and figure them out hands on, it can be more difficult if it's with a teacher though.
- I do a lot of documentation for my programs.
- I like old things, they are interesting.
- Water is great
