This post mentions every single skill I have, including things that are not worth mentioning to me or I can't dedicate a post to. Take in mind that sometimes you can't fit everything into a Resume. This is going to be a massive keyword heaven, use ctrl+f to find in page

I am making this because I had seen many job postings ask for these skills, but I don't want to include them on my resume. Does this help? Probably not
