Welcome to my blog! In this blog I attempt to show my skill, some projects, and other information that might be useful. My projects for the most part are related to Cybersecurity, and other things relevant to tech. I also look forward getting familiar with Github pages, and Jekyll.

Thanks for checking it out! Please look at my posts.
